# RUGBY_PLAYER_STATS

## üìÑ Project Overview

**RUGBY_PLAYER_STATS** is a data analysis project focused on exploring and visualizing the statistics of the best rugby players for the 2023-2024 season. This project includes data cleaning, statistical analysis, and insightful visualizations to uncover patterns and trends in player performance.

The dataset used in this project comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pierrejeanne/stats-best-rugby-player-20232024).

## üìä Dataset

### Source:
- [Kaggle Dataset: Stats Best Rugby Player 2023-2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pierrejeanne/stats-best-rugby-player-20232024)

### Description:
The dataset contains detailed information on rugby players, including their:
- Demographics (e.g., name, nationality, age, height, weight)
- Career performance in clubs and national teams
- Match statistics, including tries, points scored, and minutes played
- Discipline statistics, such as yellow and red cards

---

## üöÄ Features of the Project

### 1. **Data Cleaning**:
- Standardized inconsistent units (e.g., height in meters and centimeters).
- Handled missing and duplicate data.

### 2. **Data Analysis**:
- Explored correlations between player ranking, discipline (yellow/red cards), and performance metrics.
- Classified players into two primary categories: **Forwards** and **Backs**.

### 3. **Visualizations**:
- Distribution of player heights.
- Top nationalities represented.
- Position breakdown (pie chart) with enhanced aesthetics.
- Analysis of yellow and red cards based on player ranking.

### 4. **Machine Learning**:
- **Objective**: Predict a rugby player's position (Forward or Back) based on their physical attributes (height, weight, age, career performance statistics).
- **Algorithm Used**: Random Forest Classifier for classification.
- **Steps**:
  - Cleaned and preprocessed the data (handling missing values and encoding categorical variables).
  - Split the data into training and test sets.
  - Scaled the features for better performance in machine learning.
  - Trained the Random Forest model and evaluated it using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
  - Visualized the results with performance metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix heatmaps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries

The following Python libraries were used in this project:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **matplotlib**: For basic visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For enhanced and aesthetically pleasing plots.
- **scikit-learn**: For preprocessing and potential machine learning applications.
